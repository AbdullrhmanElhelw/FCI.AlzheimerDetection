# FCI.AlzheimerDetection

## Introduction
**"AlzAware"**
"AlzAware" is a cutting-edge application that utilizes advanced MRI scanning technology to detect and determine the level of Alzheimer's disease in patients.


## Problem Statement    

Alzheimer's disease is a progressive disorder that causes brain cells to degenerate and die. Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia â€” a continuous decline in thinking, behavioral and social skills that disrupts a person's ability to function independently. The early clinical symptoms of Alzheimer's disease are often confused with the effects of normal aging. However, the disease is fatal and advanced stages of the disease can lead to death. Early detection of Alzheimer's disease is crucial to slow down the progression of the disease and to improve the quality of life of the patient.

## Solution

"AlzAware" is a cutting-edge application that utilizes advanced MRI scanning technology to detect and determine the level of Alzheimer's disease in patients. The application uses a machine learning model that is trained on a dataset of MRI images of patients with Alzheimer's disease. The model is able to accurately detect the presence of Alzheimer's disease in patients and determine the level of the disease based on the severity of the brain damage.
